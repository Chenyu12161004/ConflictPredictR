## Overview

`PathoPrediction` is a tool for predicting the pathogenicity of human genetic variants based on a set of genomic and computational features, using pre-trained Random Forest model(at 80% split). This model was chosen over other alternatives, XGBoost and Random Forest (at 90% split), for its higher AUROC and especially better sensitivity in identifying potentially harmful variants. The package provides functions  for prediction. It also offers visualizations to explain model behavior, including feature importance bar plots and diagnostic charts (OOB error and confusion matrix). 

## Key Features

*   **Focused Prediction**: Deliver pathogenicity predictions using a single, robust Random Forest model. This approach prioritizes high sensitivity to ensure potentially harmful variants are effectively identified.

*   **Clear Feature Insights**: Help to understand model behavior with clear plots for feature importance (`plot_rf_importance()`) and model diagnostics (`plot_rf_diagnostics()`).

*   **User-Friendly Data Validation**: Include a built-in validation function, `validate_input_data()`, that checks the input data for common formatting issues and provides clear error messages.

*   **Rigorously Tested**: The package is equipped with a suite of automated tests to ensure functions behave reliably and predictably, giving users confidence in the results.

*   **Transparent Model Selection**: The package includes a performance comparison table, openly showing why the Random Forest model (at 80% split) was chosen over XGBoost and Random Forest (at 90% split) for this specific task.
    

## Model Selection

This package is built around a single Random Forest (RF) model (at 80% split). During development, other models like XGBoost were also evaluated. While all these models showed well enough overall performance, the Random Forest model demonstrated higher Sensitivity. This means it is better at correctly identifying true pathogenic variants, which minimizes the risk of missing a potentially significant variant, providing a more cautious and reliable result. 

```{r performance-table, echo=FALSE}

)

## Model Performance

The performance of the Random Forest model (at 80% split) was evaluated using AUROC and AUPRC.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `PathoPrediction` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("Chenyu12161004/PathoPrediction")
```

## Usage

First, load the package:
```{r example-load-package}
devtools::load_all()
```

### Data validation

Before making predictions, it is a good practice to validate the input data. The `validate_input_data()` function checks for required columns and data types.
```{r validation-example}
# Validate the built-in sample data (this should pass)
validate_input_data(sample_variants)
```

### Predict Pathogenicity

Use `predict_pathogenicity()` on the sample data to get predictions. The function returns the predicted class and the probability of the variant being pathogenic (class "1").

```{r prediction-example}
# Use the sample data included in the package
predictions <- predict_pathogenicity(sample_variants)

# View the key prediction results
result_subset <- predictions[, c("CADD_PHRED", "CADD_RAW", ".pred_class", ".pred_prob_pathogenic")]
knitr::kable(head(result_subset))
```
Explanation of the new columns in the report:

* `.pred_class`: The final classification from the Random Forest model (1 = pathogenic, 0 = benign).
* `pred_prob_pathogenic`: The probability that the variant is pathogenic (class "1"), according to the model. 

### Visualization: Understand Model Behavior

The package provides two functions to visualize what drives the decisions of the model.

#### Feature Importance

`plot_rf_importance()` generates a bar chart showing which features had the most influence on the model's predictions.

```{r importance-plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
plot_rf_importance()
```

#### Model Diagnostics

`plot_rf_diagnostics()` demonstrates the internal performance of the model, showing the Out-of-Bag (OOB) error rate during training and the final confusion matrix.

* **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error Rate**: This plot shows the error rate of the model as it was being trained. It is generated from data stored within the model object itself and is therefore static. It reflects the internal performance of the model during its creation.

* **Confusion Matrix**: This plot evaluates performance of the model on a specific dataset. By default, it uses the built-in sample_variants data. If you provide your own newdata, this plot will update to show the accuracy of the model on that specific data.

```{r diagnostics-plot, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
plot_rf_diagnostics()
```

## About the Model

This package is built around a single machine learning model trained on the ClinVar Conflicting dataset.

*   **Data Preprocessing**: All data was prepared using a `recipes` pipeline. This process included handling missing values, converting categorical features into dummy variables, removing zero-variance predictors, and reducing high correlation between numeric features.

*   **Random Forest Model**: Trained using the `randomForest` package with standard, empirically chosen parameters (`mtry` = sqrt(p), `ntree` = 500).

The functions in this package are direct adaptations of the original analysis script, ensuring that the research workflow is clear and reproducible.
