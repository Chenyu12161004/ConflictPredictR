Description: 
    This package predicts the likelihood that a human genetic variant will have a conflicting 
    clinical interpretation based on a set of genomic and computational features, using pre-trained 
    Random Forest model. The package provides functions for prediction. It also offers visualizations 
    to explain model behavior, including feature importance bar plots and diagnostic charts 
    (OOB error and confusion matrix).
