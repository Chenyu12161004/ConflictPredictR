Description: 
    This package predicts the pathogenicity (benign vs. pathogenic) of human 
    genetic variants based on a set of genomic and computational features, using pre-trained 
    Random Forest model. This model was chosen over another alternative, XGBoost, for its
    higher sensitivity in identifying potentially harmful variants. The package provides functions 
    for prediction. It also offers visualizations to explain model behavior, 
    including feature importance bar plots and diagnostic charts (OOB error and confusion
    matrix).
